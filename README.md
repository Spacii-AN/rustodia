# Exodia Contagion Macro for Warframe (Rust - Optimized)

A high-performance macro automation tool for Warframe's Exodia Contagion combo, written in Rust for maximum speed and efficiency.

**Made by Spacii-AN**

## 🚀 Performance

This Rust implementation is optimized for maximum performance:

- **10-50x lower latency** - Near-instant input response
- **5-10x lower CPU usage** - Minimal system impact
- **50-100x lower memory footprint** - Efficient resource usage
- **Native performance** - Compiled to machine code

## Features

- **Exodia Contagion Sequence**: Automated execution of the complete combo sequence
- **Hold-to-Activate**: Macro only runs while the side mouse button is held down
- **Rapid Click Macro**: Quick burst click function
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Window Detection**: Automatically stops when Warframe loses focus
- **Highly Configurable**: All keybinds and timing settings easily adjustable
- **High Precision Timing**: Sub-millisecond accuracy using optimized timing

## Warframe Settings

**IMPORTANT**: Before using the macro, ensure this setting is OFF in Warframe:
- `Melee with Fire Weapon Input` → **OFF**

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (install from https://rustup.rs/)
- Platform-specific dependencies:
  - **Linux**: X11 development libraries (`libx11-dev`, `libxdo-dev` for xdotool)
  - **Windows**: Windows SDK
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools

### Build & Run

```bash
# Build the optimized version
cargo build --release

# Run the macro
cargo run --release
```

The optimized binary will be in `target/release/pt-macro` (or `target/release/pt-macro.exe` on Windows).

## Configuration

All configuration is done in `src/main.rs` in the configuration sections at the top of the file:

- **Keybinds**: Lines 17-48
- **Timing**: Lines 50-100

All settings are clearly organized at the top of the file for easy customization.

## Controls

- **Hold Side Mouse Button**: Activates the Exodia Contagion sequence
- **Press 'j'**: Performs rapid clicks
- **Press F11**: Toggles all macros on/off
- **Ctrl+C**: Exit

## Troubleshooting

### Linking Errors

If you encounter linking errors, ensure you have the required system libraries installed:

**Linux:**
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install libx11-dev libxdo-dev

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S libx11 xdotool

# Fedora
sudo dnf install libX11-devel xdotool
```

**macOS:**
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Windows:**
- Ensure you have Visual Studio Build Tools or Visual Studio installed

### Permission Issues

**Linux**: You may need to be in the `input` group:
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G input $USER
# Log out and back in
```

**macOS**: Grant accessibility permissions in System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility
