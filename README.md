## Requirements

### Python
- Python 3.6 or higher

### Dependencies
Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:
```bash
pip install pynput>=1.7.6 psutil>=5.9.0
```

### Platform-Specific Requirements

#### Windows
- `pywin32` (optional, but recommended to suppress beeping sounds):
  ```bash
  pip install pywin32
  ```

#### macOS
- Accessibility permissions must be granted to Terminal/Python

## Configuration

> **📝 Configuration File**: All configuration is done by editing `pt-macro.py`. Open this file in any text editor to customize keybinds and timing settings.

### Warframe Settings
**IMPORTANT**: Before using the macro, ensure this setting is OFF in Warframe:
- `Melee with Fire Weapon Input` → **OFF**

### Keybinds
Edit the `KEYBINDS` dictionary in `pt-macro.py` (lines 53-62) to customize controls:

```python
# Enable/disable alternative macro button (line 47)
ENABLE_MACRO_ALT = True  # Set to False to disable second side mouse button

KEYBINDS = {
    'melee': 'e',                    # Melee attack key
    'jump': Key.space,               # Jump key
    'aim': Button.right,             # Aim button (right mouse)
    'fire': Button.left,             # Fire button (left mouse)
    'emote': '.',                    # Emote key
    'macro': None,                   # Auto-detects: Button.x1 (Windows) or Button.button8 (Linux/macOS)
    'macro_alt': None,               # Auto-detects: Button.x2 (Windows) or Button.button9 (Linux/macOS)
    'rapid_click': 'j',              # Rapid click macro key
}
```

**Important Note on Side Mouse Buttons:**
- **Windows**: Uses `Button.x1` and `Button.x2` for side mouse buttons
- **Linux/macOS**: Uses `Button.button8` and `Button.button9` for side mouse buttons
- The macro **automatically detects** the correct button for your platform
- You can **manually override** by setting `'macro'` and `'macro_alt'` to any button/key you want (see examples below)

#### Disabling Alternative Macro Button
If you only want to use one side mouse button, open `pt-macro.py` and set `ENABLE_MACRO_ALT = False` on line 47. This will disable the second side mouse button (x2/button9) from triggering the macro.

#### Changing the Macro Button

You can easily change the macro button by editing the `'macro'` value in `KEYBINDS` in `pt-macro.py`. Here are examples:

**Side Mouse Buttons (Platform-Specific):**
```python
# Windows
'macro': Button.x1,        # First side button (x1)
'macro': Button.x2,       # Second side button (x2)

# Linux/macOS
'macro': Button.button8,  # First side button (button8)
'macro': Button.button9,  # Second side button (button9)
```

**Other Mouse Buttons:**
```python
'macro': Button.middle,   # Middle mouse button (scroll wheel click)
'macro': Button.right,   # Right mouse button (not recommended - conflicts with aim)
```

**Keyboard Keys:**
```python
'macro': Key.f1,         # Function keys (F1-F12)
'macro': Key.f2,
'macro': Key.ctrl,       # Control key
'macro': Key.shift,      # Shift key
'macro': 'q',            # Letter keys (make sure they don't conflict with game controls)
'macro': 'z',
```

**Examples:**
```python
# Use middle mouse button instead of side button
'macro': Button.middle,

# Use F1 key instead
'macro': Key.f1,

# Use Q key instead
'macro': 'q',
```

> **Note**: If you set `'macro'` to `None`, it will auto-detect the correct side mouse button for your platform (Button.x1 on Windows, Button.button8 on Linux/macOS).

> **Note**: For a complete list of all available buttons and keys, see [BUTTON_REFERENCE.md](BUTTON_REFERENCE.md)

### Fine-Tuning the Macro

> **📝 Remember**: All timing adjustments are made in `pt-macro.py`. Open the file and look for the **TIMING CONFIGURATION** section (lines 64-106). The configuration is clearly separated from code logic with an "END OF USER CONFIGURATION" marker at line 107.

All timing values are now organized in a dedicated **TIMING CONFIGURATION** section (lines 64-106) for easy adjustment. Here's what each setting does:

#### Game FPS (Line 71)
```python
FPS = 115  # Set this to match your in-game FPS
```
- **What it does**: Base FPS value used for automatic timing calculations
- **When to adjust**: If your game runs at a different FPS than 115

#### Jump Timing (Lines 74-75)
```python
JUMP_DELAY_MS = 1100  # Milliseconds between jumps
DOUBLE_JUMP_DELAY = JUMP_DELAY_MS / FPS / 1000
```
- **What it does**: Controls delay between double jumps and emote presses
- **When to adjust**: If jumps feel too fast/slow, or emote timing is off
- **Lower value** = faster jumps, **Higher value** = slower jumps

#### Aim & Melee Timing (Lines 78-79)
```python
AIM_MELEE_DELAY = 0.025  # Delay between aim and melee (seconds)
MELEE_HOLD_TIME = 0.050  # How long to hold melee (seconds)
```
- **AIM_MELEE_DELAY**: Time between pressing aim and pressing melee
  - **Lower** = faster melee activation
  - **Higher** = more delay before melee
- **MELEE_HOLD_TIME**: Duration melee key is held down
  - **Lower** = shorter melee press
  - **Higher** = longer melee press

#### Emote Cancel Timing (Lines 81-93)
```python
USE_EMOTE_FORMULA = True  # Use formula or manual delay
EMOTE_PREPARATION_DELAY_MANUAL = 0.100  # Manual delay (if formula disabled)
```
- **Formula-based** (default): Automatically calculates optimal delay based on FPS
- **Manual mode**: Set `USE_EMOTE_FORMULA = False` and adjust `EMOTE_PREPARATION_DELAY_MANUAL`
- **When to adjust**: If emote cancel isn't working properly

#### Rapid Fire Timing (Lines 96-97)
```python
RAPID_FIRE_DURATION_MS = 230  # Total rapid fire duration (milliseconds)
RAPID_FIRE_CLICK_DELAY = 0.001  # Delay between shots (seconds)
```
- **RAPID_FIRE_DURATION_MS**: How long the rapid fire sequence lasts
  - **Lower** = shorter burst
  - **Higher** = longer burst
- **RAPID_FIRE_CLICK_DELAY**: Time between each shot
  - **Lower** = faster firing rate
  - **Higher** = slower firing rate

#### Sequence Loop Timing (Lines 100-101)
```python
SEQUENCE_END_DELAY = 0.050  # Delay at end of sequence (seconds)
LOOP_DELAY = 0.0005  # Delay between sequence loops (seconds)
```
- **SEQUENCE_END_DELAY**: Pause after completing one full sequence
- **LOOP_DELAY**: Delay before starting the next sequence
  - **Lower** = faster repetition
  - **Higher** = slower repetition

#### Rapid Click Macro (Lines 104-105)
```python
RAPID_CLICK_COUNT = 10  # Number of clicks
RAPID_CLICK_DELAY = 0.05  # Delay between clicks (seconds)
```
- **RAPID_CLICK_COUNT**: How many clicks to perform
- **RAPID_CLICK_DELAY**: Time between each click

### Quick Reference: Most Common Adjustments

| Issue | Line to Edit | What to Change |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Macro too fast/slow overall | 71 | Adjust `FPS` to match your game |
| Jumps feel off | 74 | Adjust `JUMP_DELAY_MS` (in milliseconds) |
| Melee not activating properly | 78 | Adjust `AIM_MELEE_DELAY` (lower = faster) |
| Melee held too long/short | 79 | Adjust `MELEE_HOLD_TIME` |
| Emote cancel not working | 84-85 | Set `USE_EMOTE_FORMULA = False` and adjust `EMOTE_PREPARATION_DELAY_MANUAL` |
| Rapid fire too short/long | 96 | Adjust `RAPID_FIRE_DURATION_MS` |
| Rapid fire too fast/slow | 97 | Adjust `RAPID_FIRE_CLICK_DELAY` |
| Sequences repeating too fast | 101 | Increase `LOOP_DELAY` |

## Usage

### Running the Script

**Option 1: Using the launcher (Easiest - Recommended)**
- **Windows**: Double-click `launch.bat`
- **macOS**: Double-click `launch.command`
- **Linux**: Double-click `launch.sh` or run `./launch.sh`

The launcher will automatically:
- Check for Python installation
- Create a virtual environment (if needed)
- Install/update all dependencies
- Start the macro

**Option 2: Direct execution**
```bash
python pt-macro.py
```

**Option 3: Using virtual environment (if you created one manually)**
```bash
./venv/bin/python pt-macro.py  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\python pt-macro.py  # Windows
```
*Note: The launcher scripts automatically create and use a virtual environment, so this is only needed if you created one manually.*

### Controls

- **Hold Side Mouse Button (x1 or x2)**: Activates the Exodia Contagion sequence
  - The macro runs continuously while the button is held
  - Releases immediately when you let go of the button
  
- **Press 'j'**: Performs 10 rapid left mouse clicks

- **Press F11**: Toggles all macros on/off

### How It Works

The Exodia Contagion sequence executes:
1. Double jump
2. Aim + Melee attack
3. Emote cancel (timing based on FPS)
4. Rapid fire sequence

The macro automatically stops if:
- You release the side mouse button
- Warframe window loses focus
- You toggle macros off with F11

## Troubleshooting

### Macro doesn't start
- Ensure Warframe is the active/focused window
- Check that "Melee with Fire Weapon Input" is OFF in Warframe settings
- Verify you have the required permissions (macOS accessibility, Linux input device access)

### Macro runs but timing is off
- Open `pt-macro.py` and adjust the `FPS` variable (line 71) to match your actual in-game FPS
- Fine-tune individual timing values in the **TIMING CONFIGURATION** section (lines 64-106) of `pt-macro.py`
- See the "Fine-Tuning the Macro" section above for detailed timing adjustments
- Check that your system can handle the precision timing

### Permission errors (Linux)
- You may need to be in the `input` group:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -a -G input $USER
  ```
  (Log out and back in for changes to take effect)

### Beeping sounds (Windows)
- Install `pywin32` to use direct input and suppress beeping:
  ```bash
  pip install pywin32
  ```

### Window detection not working (Linux)
- Install `xdotool` or `wmctrl` for better window detection
- The macro will still work using process detection as a fallback
