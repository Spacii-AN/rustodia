# Exodia Contagion Macro for Warframe

A cross-platform Python macro automation tool for Warframe's Exodia Contagion combo. Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

**Made by Spacii-AN**

## Features

- **Exodia Contagion Sequence**: Automated execution of the complete combo sequence
- **Hold-to-Activate**: Macro only runs while the side mouse button is held down
- **Rapid Click Macro**: Quick 10-click burst function
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Window Detection**: Automatically stops when Warframe loses focus
- **Configurable**: Easy-to-modify keybinds and timing settings
- **High Precision**: Optimized timing for consistent execution

## Requirements

### Python
- Python 3.6 or higher

### Dependencies
Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:
```bash
pip install pynput>=1.7.6 psutil>=5.9.0
```

### Platform-Specific Requirements

#### Windows
- `pywin32` (optional, but recommended to suppress beeping sounds):
  ```bash
  pip install pywin32
  ```

#### macOS
- Accessibility permissions must be granted to Terminal/Python
- Go to: System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility

#### Linux
- Optional tools for better window detection:
  ```bash
  # Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo apt install xdotool wmctrl
  
  # Arch Linux
  sudo pacman -S xdotool wmctrl
  
  # Fedora
  sudo dnf install xdotool wmctrl
  ```
  *Note: The macro will still work without these tools using process detection*

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd PTmacro
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

### Warframe Settings
**IMPORTANT**: Before using the macro, ensure this setting is OFF in Warframe:
- `Melee with Fire Weapon Input` → **OFF**

### Keybinds
Edit the `KEYBINDS` dictionary in `5th_try.py` to customize controls:

```python
KEYBINDS = {
    'melee': 'e',                    # Melee attack key
    'jump': Key.space,               # Jump key
    'aim': Button.right,             # Aim button (right mouse)
    'fire': Button.left,             # Fire button (left mouse)
    'emote': '.',                    # Emote key
    'macro': Button.button8,         # Side mouse button (x1)
    'macro_alt': Button.button9,     # Alternative side button (x2)
    'rapid_click': 'j',              # Rapid click macro key
}
```

### FPS Settings
Adjust the `FPS` variable to match your Warframe FPS for optimal timing:
```python
FPS = 115  # Change to match your in-game FPS
```

## Usage

### Running the Script

**Option 1: Direct execution**
```bash
python 5th_try.py
```

**Option 2: Using the run script (Linux/macOS)**
```bash
./run.sh
```

**Option 3: Using virtual environment**
```bash
./venv/bin/python 5th_try.py
```

### Controls

- **Hold Side Mouse Button (x1 or x2)**: Activates the Exodia Contagion sequence
  - The macro runs continuously while the button is held
  - Releases immediately when you let go of the button
  
- **Press 'j'**: Performs 10 rapid left mouse clicks

- **Press F11**: Toggles all macros on/off

### How It Works

The Exodia Contagion sequence executes:
1. Double jump
2. Aim + Melee attack
3. Emote cancel (timing based on FPS)
4. Rapid fire sequence

The macro automatically stops if:
- You release the side mouse button
- Warframe window loses focus
- You toggle macros off with F11

## Troubleshooting

### Macro doesn't start
- Ensure Warframe is the active/focused window
- Check that "Melee with Fire Weapon Input" is OFF in Warframe settings
- Verify you have the required permissions (macOS accessibility, Linux input device access)

### Macro runs but timing is off
- Adjust the `FPS` variable to match your actual in-game FPS
- Check that your system can handle the precision timing

### Permission errors (Linux)
- You may need to be in the `input` group:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -a -G input $USER
  ```
  (Log out and back in for changes to take effect)

### Beeping sounds (Windows)
- Install `pywin32` to use direct input and suppress beeping:
  ```bash
  pip install pywin32
  ```

### Window detection not working (Linux)
- Install `xdotool` or `wmctrl` for better window detection
- The macro will still work using process detection as a fallback
